### About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aramali Mohammed, a passionate software enthusiast with a love for problem-solving and creativity. 

### My Journey with Programming

As a child, I was captivated by gaming. The idea of creating my own worlds and adventures led me to dive into the world of programming. I started my journey by learning programming to build games. Through trial and error, I stumbled upon the beauty of coding. It was when I ran my first "hello world" program with C that I realized my deep fascination with programming. From that moment on, I was hooked.

### Current Pursuits

Nowadays, I've migrated to Java and continue to explore its endless possibilities. I'm currently pursuing my studies in software engineering at FSTS, where I'm constantly refining my skills and knowledge in the field. My passion for both frontend and backend development has led me to aspire to become a full-stack developer.

### Future Goals

I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in a real-world setting. I'm on the lookout for a PFA internship where I can contribute as a full-stack developer, leveraging my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, React.js, and more.

Feel free to reach out, connect, and embark on this exciting journey with me! ðŸ˜Š
